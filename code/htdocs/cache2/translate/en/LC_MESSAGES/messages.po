" <br />\n"
"welcome to the english version of opencaching.de. We created these pages to make it easier for you to use the opencaching platform. Actually you may find or even list caches worldwide on opencaching.de, although the primary focus is the german speaking part of europe until now. Please be aware that today there are only few users which use opencaching.de for worldwide caching, but you may help opencaching to spread across more countries with your international listings and logs. If you have any questions about the usage of the opencaching platform, feel free to get in contact with us.<br />\n"
" <br />\n"
"Due to the fact that opencaching.de is a non-profit project run by volunteers, unfortunately we do not really have the capacity to run a worldwide caching plattform or provide full international user support on our own. We need your help to build a real worldwide opencaching network. If you want to support our project, you may host your own opencaching node for your country. The idea is to have several opencaching nodes for different countries around the world with a synchronized database of users and caches. If you want to launch an new opencaching site in your country, please get in contact with us. We will provide you with the necessary source code and some support for the first setup. Besides that, you may support us by translating the opencaching software into your language or by offering email support for your country. We will implement your translation on opencaching.de until a native node will be available in your area.<br />\n"
